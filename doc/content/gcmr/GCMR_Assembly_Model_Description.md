# Gas-cooled Microreactor Assembly Model Description

The Gas-Cooled Microreactor (GC-MR) assembly model was developed at ANL as a modeling experiment that gathers several expected modeling challenges encountered by the U.S. industry. The GC-MR assembly uses a graphite structure, TRISO fuel blocks with 19.95 at% LEU fuel, YH2 moderator pins with FeCrAl envelope, and upper/lower BeO reflector regions. Additional modeling specificities were implemented in the GC-MR such as burnable poison blocks, helium coolant channels and a central control and shutdown rod.
[Fig_1] illustrates the GC-MR assembly model.
